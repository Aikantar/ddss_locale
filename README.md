Content:
Ð•ach directory contains:

 - the original file with quests
 - a quest file prepared for localization  (replaced). Must be renamed to DefaultQuests.json
 - Localization file (for each language its own).
 - Resource pack in which localization files should be placed (English and others), and after that it should be installed into the assembly as a regular resource pack



## How to help with translation into another language?

You need to make a Fork repository, translate the localization file (create a new one, if necessary), then make a pull request and the file will be published and added to the resource pack
